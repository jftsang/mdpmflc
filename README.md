# mdpmflc - a web interface for MercuryDPM

[MercuryDPM](www.mercurydpm.org) is an excellent open-source package for
conducting discrete particle model simulations of granular materials.

**mdpmflc** offers a web interface for starting MercuryDPM simulations,
controlling their execution, as well as producing graphic visualisations
of their output.

It uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) framework.


## Maintainer and website

The author and maintainer is J. M. F. Tsang (`j.m.f.tsang@cantab.net`). 

The project is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/jftsang/mdpmflc).

There currently isn't any 'demo' website on the WWW, sorry.
